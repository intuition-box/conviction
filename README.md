# Debate App

Structured debates on a decentralized knowledge graph.

Debate App is a social debate platform where every contribution is decomposed into semantic triples (subject-predicate-object) and published on-chain via the [Intuition](https://intuition.systems) protocol. Debates accumulate into a reusable reasoning graph rather than resetting each time.

## Features

- **LLM extraction pipeline** — free-form text is automatically decomposed into structured semantic triples through a multi-stage agent pipeline (selection, decomposition, graph extraction, relation detection)
- **On-chain publishing** — triples are published as atoms and triples on the Intuition protocol, creating a permanent, queryable knowledge graph
- **Stance system** — replies take an explicit stance (support or refute) against a parent claim, with signal deposits
- **Nested relations** — the pipeline detects inter-claim relations (conditions, attributions, causal links) and publishes them as supporting context
- **Multi-post atomic publishing** — users can split complex arguments into multiple posts, published in a single idempotent transaction
- **Theme-based organization** — debates are grouped by theme for browsable exploration

```

**`packages/agents`** implements the extraction pipeline and deterministic post-processing using the Vercel AI SDK, Groq, and local helpers for canonicalization, nested edges, stance checks, and atom matching.

**`apps/web`** is the Next.js application handling both the UI (React 19 + Radix) and the API layer. Proposals live in React state during the composition flow and are published atomically on-chain via the Intuition SDK.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 10+
- PostgreSQL 16+ (or Docker)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd debate-app

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start PostgreSQL
docker compose up -d

# Configure environment
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
# Edit apps/web/.env with your values (see Environment Variables below)

# Run database migrations and seed
cd apps/web
pnpm prisma migrate deploy
pnpm seed
cd ../..

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build

```bash
pnpm build   # compiles all packages + Next.js
pnpm start   # runs the production server (from apps/web)
```

## Environment Variables

Copy `apps/web/.env.example` to `apps/web/.env` and fill in the values:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Random string, min 32 characters (required in production) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_INTUITION_CHAIN_ID` | Intuition network chain ID (`1155` for mainnet) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_INTUITION_GRAPHQL_URL` | Intuition GraphQL endpoint |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq API key |
| `GROQ_MODEL` | Groq model name |

## Architecture

### Extraction Pipeline

When a user submits text, it goes through a multi-stage LLM pipeline:

```
User text
  │
  ▼
Selection ──► keeps relevant claims, resolves pronouns, classifies kind
  │
  ▼
Decomposition ──► splits multi-claim sentences on discourse markers
  │                (but, because, if, which...)
  ▼
Graph Extraction ──► extracts core {subject, predicate, object} + modifiers
  │
  ▼
Relation Detection ──► identifies inter-claim relations (cause, contrast, condition)
  │
  ▼
Stance Verification ──► checks alignment with user's declared stance (optional)
  │
  ▼
Proposals (React state) ──► user reviews, splits into drafts, publishes on-chain
```

Guard-rails skip agent calls when discourse markers are absent, saving LLM round-trips.

### Data Flow

1. **Extraction** — `/api/extract` calls `runExtraction()` from `@db/agents`, returns proposals to the client
2. **Composition** — proposals live in React state only; users review, split into draft posts, select stances
3. **Resolution** — client resolves atom labels to on-chain term IDs via the Intuition SDK
4. **Publishing** — `/api/publish` creates all posts, atoms, triples, and links in a single idempotent transaction

### Database

The local database (5 tables) stores references only — never duplicates Intuition on-chain data:

- **User** — wallet address, display name
- **Theme** — debate topics (slug as PK for clean URLs)
- **Post** — body, stance, theme, parent post link
- **PostTripleLink** — maps posts to on-chain triple IDs with role (primary/supporting)
- **Submission** — tracks extraction workflow state

## API Routes

## Roadmap

- **Themes as on-chain atoms** — publish theme metadata to Intuition for cross-app discoverability
- **Atom UX + Explore Drawer** — usage stats, reuse suggestions when composing triples
- **Web2 onboarding** — energy-based system (no wallet required) for frictionless onboarding
- **LLM optimization** — parallelize agent calls, batch operations, response caching

## Contributing

### Conventions

- UI labels go in `apps/web/src/lib/vocabulary.ts` (no hardcoded web3 jargon)
- Components use CSS Modules (`.module.css`)
- Shared design tokens live in `apps/web/src/styles/design-system.css`
